### Developing:
The frontend client of the game is develped using Typescript + HTML. For this, I have created the tool [InlineScript (tshtml)](https://github.com/Zekiah-A/InlineScript) that allows you to transpile the site's custom *.tshtml format into a normal Javascript + HTML file that may be used within the browser. Do not directly edit any .HTML file, as updates to this file will not be persisted when the site is built, instead modify the .tshtml equivalent to make modifications to the site's codebase.
